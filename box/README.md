# Specific box implementation

## Example
Copy the box/config.yaml.dist file to box/config.yml change the values to your needs. The default values in the 
config.yml.dist file can also be used as an example to see how it works.

You can use all kind of vagrant boxes that are provided on[Vagrant Cloud](https://app.vagrantup.com/boxes/search), the 
only thing that this template expects is that either nginx or apache is available in the box because it tries to set the vhost.
